      get_in_touch:
        question: How do I get in touch with InteriorCrowd?
        answer: We love any feedback! Please email us at %{hello_email}
      what_is:
        question: What is InteriorCrowd?
        answer: >
          InteriorCrowd is a fun and affordable way for busy people to get an inspiring home design
          from a professional designer online. We connect designers with new clients, while our
          software allows designers to focus on what they love - design.
      who_are_designers:
        question: Who are our designers?
        answer: >
          Our designers are talented professionals from anywhere in the world. They are chosen to
          design for InteriorCrowd based on a combination of factors like portfolio, awards and raw
          talent.
      style_profile:
        question: How does the style profile work?
        answer: >
          The style profile was created in collaboration with our designers as a fun and easy way to
          figure out how best to style an amazing new space for you. Most people don’t stick to one
          style, and the profile takes this into account.
      packages:
        question: Which package should I choose?
        answer: >
          It depends on how much help you need - The Quick Fix being the least amount of help, and
          Room Overhaul being the most. You’re not married to your decision though. If through the
          collaborative process with your designer, they realize you chose incorrectly, this choice can
          be amended (you might just need more help than you thought!).
      contests:
        question: How do contests work?
        answer: >
          First you fill out the style profile, then give us as much detailed information about your specific
          room’s needs as possible. All our designers then receive your brief and those who want to
          take on the project will send you a concept board reflecting their suggested direction for your
          room. You pick which concept board you like the most (the winning design) and continue to
          the next collaborative phase of designing your room with that specific designer.
      how_many_designs:
        question: How many designs will I get?
        answer: You will always receive at least two designs, but it could be more.
      how_to_collaborate_with_designer:
        question: How do I collaborate with my designer?
        answer: >
          Every time your designer sends you a question you’ll receive an email notification with a link
          that will take you directly to the Client Center where you and your designer can communicate.
          Alternatively, just log in and go directly to your Client Center to send your designer a question.
      how_long:
        question: How long does the process take?
        answer: >
          Generally, the process takes between 1 to 2 weeks. We have a few deadlines in place to
          keep the process moving along swiftly. A huge benefit of InteriorCrowd is how quickly you can
          go from frustration with your room - to inspired for your new space! So, we ask that you
          respond to your designer within the time frame given to you. All details are on the platform,
          and you will be notified along the way too.
      forgot_password:
        question: >
          I forgot my password - how do I log in?
        answer: >
          Please click on the forgot password link and enter your username. A link to reset your
          password will be sent to the email address on file. Click on that link, and you will be led to an
          area to reset the password. If you have any issues, you can always contact us at
          %{hello_email}.
      measuring:
        question: How do I measure my room?
        answer: >
          Get your tape measure ready! We find it’s easiest to make a simple drawing of your space
          first and then fill in the measurements as you go. You can also take a photo of this drawing and
          upload it to the other photo’s of your space. Your designer can guide you if they need more
          detailed measurements, but for now, just measure the length and width of the room,
          indicating important details like door openings and indentations/nooks.
    designer:
      what_is_beta:
        question: What is beta mode?
        answer: >
          This means we are still testing the product and learning from both the client and designer’s
          experience. It also means that not all elements of the final product are available yet. The final
          product will look quite different to how it looks right now. There will be bugs too, so please be
          patient - and let us know of any issues you’re experiencing.
      how_contest_work:
        question: How do contests work?
        answer: >
          First, a client fills out the style profile, giving us as much detailed information about their
          specific room’s needs as possible. All the designers will receive the brief and those who want
          to take on the project will send the client a concept board reflecting their suggested direction
          for the room. The client then picks which concept board they like the most (the winning
          design) and continue to the next collaborative phase of designing their room with that specific
          designer.
      how_communicate_client:
        question: How do I communicate with the client?
        answer: >
          All communication will take place in the Client Center on the platform. You will always be
          notified via email if the client has added any feedback to your designs.
      specs_of_design:
        question: What are the specs of the designs I upload for the client?
        answer: |
          Concept board: w: 752px h: 664px

          Final Design: w: 851px h: 751px
      vendors:
        question: Which vendors can I source from?
        answer: >
          You are welcome to choose from vendors that meet your client’s aesthetic, budget, and
          quality requirements. But please choose reputable vendors that you know you can rely on.
          We want clients to have a positive experience when they order the goods.
      can_include_work_in_portfolio:
        question: Can I include the work I do for InteriorCrowd in my portfolio?
        answer: >
          In most instances we’d love you to add your InteriorCrowd to your portfolio. But please
          reference InteriorCrowd, and don’t add the client’s details, for privacy reasons.

        name: Jane L.
        story: >
          We really liked all the furniture in our dining area, but
          were just missing something to give the room that Wow Factor. Our designer picked a statement light fixture
          that we probably wouldn’t have picked ourselves and
          it’s completely transformed the room.
      john_story:
        name: John G.
        story: >
          This bed was always one of my favorite pieces, but when my husband and I got married I wasn’t sure
          it would work in our new bedroom. Our designer showed us with a few simple additions (wall color,
          a side table - and a few accessories) how we could bring our things together in a room that we now both love.
      audrey_story:
        name: Audrey S.
        story: >
          I love the look & ease of our new living room! I was
          so happy our designer was able to work in the hanging woven chair I’ve always wanted. We were particularly
          impressed with the level of detail our designer was
          able to plan for us - from the sofa right down to room
          accessories like bowls for the table. It’s a perfect room.
