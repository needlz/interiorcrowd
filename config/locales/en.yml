      vintage:
        name: Vintage
        description: >
          Originally sourced from flea-markets and antique stores to bring more eclectic pieces
          (and a bit of history) into a room, the vintage trend is now reflected by the
          increased popularity of retailers creating new pieces with a vintage feel. Choose
          either original pieces or “vintage inspired” from more mainstream retailers.
        retailers: |
          - Budget-friendly original pieces and replicas: Etsy & Chairish
          - For inspiration (or for the less budget-conscious): 1stdibs
          - ”Vintage Inspired” retailers: Restoration Hardware, Anthropologie, One King’s Lane, Schoolhouse Electric, Rejuvenation
      eclectic:
        name: Eclectic
        description: >
          It’s all about mixing and matching various styles and colors to create a unique look.
          Pick from a variety of modern retailers and match with vintage pieces for a more ‘worldly’ feel.
          Brighten up the room with patterns, color pops and ethnic prints.
        retailers: |
          - For the less budget conscious: Design Within Reach, BluDot, Hive Modern, Coup d’etat
          - More budget friendly: Room & Board, CB2
          - Vintage Inspired: One King’s Lane.
          - Worldly approach: Anthropologie, Cost Plus, Pier 1
      midcentury_modern:
        name: Mid-Century Modern
        description: >
          Often called "mod" and most definitely “retro”, this style is marked by simplicity,
          clean lines, organic forms, and materials such as wood, metal, and plastic.
          A key element is to bring the outdoors in by making the space feel as light and airy as possible.
          Molded plywood and plastic is very popular in modern furniture, as well as polished metal.
          Furniture is minimal and raised off the floor to allow the space to open up.
        retailers: |
          - Room and Board, HD Buttercup, West Elm, CB2 and Design Within Reach, Dwell Studio, BoConcept,
          Cisco Brothers
          - Online representing physical showrooms: 1st Dibs
          - Online-only retailers: One King’s Lane, Chairish, Wayfair, Amazon (if you know what you are looking for) Dot & Bo.
      rustic_elegance:
        name: Rustic Elegance
        description: >
          Rustic elegance is a combination of natural materials (like distressed wood) with modern or
          luxurious decor or accessories (like chandeliers) - to present a room that is cozy but stylish.
          This style incorporates some of the farm-inspired pieces that echo that comfortable lifestyle.

          Restoration Hardware, Rejuvenation, Schoolhouse Electric
      coastal:
        name: Coastal
        description: >
          Light and relaxed is the essence of coastal (also called california casual).
          This style uses light colors (blue and green hues with bright whites) and an abundance
          of natural materials like distressed or cerused wooden furniture, jute rugs and handmade
          accessories to create a breezy, summery vibe. Many retailers will have pieces fitting
          this casual coastal theme - for example, nautical accents from West Elm, raffia furniture
          from Serena & Lily, and striped pillows from Pier 1.
        retailers: |
          Serena & Lily, West Elm, Pottery Barn, Wisteria, Pier 1, Home Goods
          Online Only Retailers: Wayfair, One King’s Lane
      traditional:
        name: Traditional
        description: >
          Trademarks of this style generally include deep wood tones, an abundance of
          architectural details (thick moldings, for example), and elegant furnishings.
          One of the most important facets of traditional interior design is the silhouettes of the pieces.
          Wingback chairs, claw footed tables - chairs or tubs, and curved furniture pieces are
          examples of how designers are finding inspiration in the ornate decor from the 18th and 19th centuries.
          Antiques are also often integrated into this design style, but many companies like
          Pottery Barn, Baker Furniture and Ballard Designs sell new pieces that mimic the lines of the old.
        retailers: >
          Baker, Kravet, Jan Showers, C. Mariani, Cache Collection, Caperton Collection, Dennis & Leen,
          Ann Getty House Collection, Pottery Barn, Baker Furniture, Ballard Designs
      transitional:
        name: Transitional
        description: >
          Transitional is a blend of traditional and contemporary styles, mid-way between Old World
          traditional and the world of chrome and glass contemporary; incorporating lines that are
          less ornate than traditional designs, but not as severely basic as contemporary lines.
        retailers: >
          Formations, David Iatesta, Ironies, Oly Studio, Made Goods, Mr. Brown Home,
          Julian Chichester, Ruby Living, Williams-Sonoma Home, Crate & Barrel
      modern:
        name: Modern
        description: >
          Clean, straight lines and simple, minimalistic decor are the main characteristics of a
          modern style. Many retailers today have pieces that are modern, with bigger brands
          like Design Within Reach, Room and Board being amongst the most popular.
          For more budget-conscious options, look at IKEA and CB2.
        retailers: >
          Design Within Reach, Scandinavian Designs, Roche Bobois, Herman Miller, Dot & Bo, EQ3, IKEA, CB2
      hollywood_regency:
        name: Hollywood Regency
        description: >
          Hollywood celebrates glitz and glamour - a time when cocktail parties were more popular
          than television series. This look can be achieved by mixing furniture from various other
          styles (from traditional to modern Art Deco) with an emphasis on details - glamorous mirrors,
          lacquered furniture, lots of gold and unexpected color combinations. The more luxurious,
          the better. Original Dorothy Draper items can be purchased from 1stdibs for a great investment
          piece, or go to Jonathan Adler for fun accessories.
        retailers: >

        This room has a lot of potential! I saw from your style profile that you
        love mid-century modern and eclectic styles, so I've added a few pieces
        that I think will go really well with your existing furniture in your living
        room within your allocated budget. If you pick me as a winner we can look into
        some options for paint as I think a lighter color will really brighten this room up.

        question: What is InteriorCrowd?
        answer: >
          InteriorCrowd is a fun and affordable way for busy people to get an inspiring home design
          from a professional designer online. We connect designers with new clients, while our
          software allows designers to focus on what they love - design.
      what_is_crowdsourcing:
        question: What does 'crowdsourcing' mean?
        answer: >
          Crowdsourcing is a great way to get ideas from multiple people for one project. Our
          crowdsourcing model starts with the client (you!) developing a personal style brief and
          sharing pictures of your space. That brief goes out to a network of talented designers (a
          mix of local, national and international talent) who will send you a number of different
          concept boards that take into account your individual taste, budget, and functional
          needs (i.e. relaxing, entertaining, working from home, pets, etc.). This way, you are able
          to see lots of different viewpoints before picking who you want to work with.
      who_are_designers:
        question: Who are our designers?
        answer: >
          Our designers are talented professionals from anywhere in the world. They are chosen to
          design for InteriorCrowd based on a combination of factors like portfolio, awards and raw
          talent.
      how_many_designers:
        question: How many designers will I get to choose from?
        answer: >
          Each project usually receives 3&#45;5 concept boards from designers, but some projects do
          get more. The more information you put in your brief, the more likely you are to get a lot
          of interest from our network of designers.
      want_to_meet_designer:
        question: What if I want to meet my designer in-person?
        answer: >
          If you’d like to meet your designer in-person you should add this to your brief so that
          only designers in your area will submit boards to your project. An in-person meeting
          operates on an hourly fee structure and is not included in the $299 price point.
      style_profile:
        question: How does the style profile work?
        answer: >
          The style profile was created in collaboration with our designers as a fun and easy way to
          figure out how best to style an amazing new space for you. Most people don’t stick to one
          style, and the profile takes this into account.
      what_do_I_get:
        question: What exactly do I get for $299?
        answer: >
          ● Multiple concept boards (choose your own designer based on their
          recommendations for your space/project)<br\>
          ● 10-15 minute Facetime or Call with your designer<br/>
          ● Floorplan (spatial planning)<br/>
          ● Suggestions for new items (furniture, decor etc) with 2 iterations<br/>
          ● If a floorplan isn’t necessary, an updated concept board (either a perspective
          rendering or a pdf with prompts)<br/><br/>
          If you’d like additional time with your designer, please %{additional_time_with_designer}
      I_want_two_things:
        question: I only want one or two things. Is this for me?
        answer: >
          Yes! This is their specialty. They will work around your room’s unique needs and within
          your budget.
      what_does_cost_meeting_with_designer:
        question: What does it cost for an in-person meeting?
        answer: >
          If you want to explore the in-person model, we would recommend a package that
          combines in-person hourly fees with a standard set of assets (layout plans, furniture &
          accessory shopping list, assembly plan) delivered via our online platform. An initial
          in-person meeting with your designer is an additional $100/hour but you can also
          purchase further in-person hours if necessary.
      additional_time_with_designer:
        question: What if I want additional time with my designer?
        answer: >
          If you’ve already had two iterations of products and a 15 minute call and would still like
          more time with your designer, you may request additional Add-on’s. These could be the
          following:
          <br/><br/>
          ● In-person time ($100/hour)<br/>
          ● Additional Facetime/Call time (to be determined by designer)<br/>
          ● Another round of products (to be determined by designer)<br/>
      designer_can_help_me_with:
        question: What can my designer help me with?
        answer: >
          Your designer will look at your brief and assess what you should get rid of and what you
          need to purchase. They can help you with paint color, furniture pieces, rearranging your
          room (spatial design), flooring, floor coverings, window treatments, light fixtures, decor,
          wallpaper - you name it.<br/><br/>
          Additionally, they can also take a look at your project before you do a renovation and
          give you a consultation on what to focus on and how to spend your budget. For the
          latter, we’d recommend an in-person consultation. For more info, %{what_does_cost_meeting_with_designer}
      what_if_I_dont_like_the_products:
        question: What if I don’t like the products the designer recommends?
        answer: >
          You have the opportunity to receive 2 iterations of products from your designer. Please
          give them as much feedback as possible if you don’t like the items they have
          recommended for you. It is highly unlikely that you won’t like what your designer puts
          together for you the second time around if you let them know why you didn’t like the first
          batch!
      which_package_should_I_choose:
        question: Which package should I choose?
        answer: See %{what_do_I_get}
      how_do_I_measure:
        question: How do I measure my room?
        answer: >
          Get your tape measure ready! We find it’s easiest to make a simple drawing of your space
          first and then fill in the measurements as you go. You can also take a photo of this drawing and
          upload it to the other photo’s of your space. Your designer can guide you if they need more
          detailed measurements, but for now, just measure the length and width of the room,
          indicating important details like door openings and indentations/nooks.
      how_do_contests_work:
        question: How do contests work?
        answer: >
          First you fill out the style profile, then give us as much detailed information about your specific
          room’s needs as possible. All our designers then receive your brief and those who want to
          take on the project will send you a concept board reflecting their suggested direction for your
          room. You pick which concept board you like the most (the winning design) and continue to
          the next collaborative phase of designing your room with that specific designer.
      how_to_collaborate_with_designer:
        question: How do I collaborate with my designer?
        answer: >
          Once you’ve picked your designer, you’ll hop on a quick call to confirm everything in
          your brief and get to know each other a bit better. From then on you’ll use the platform
          for communicate. Every time your designer sends you a question you’ll receive an email
          notification that will have a link that will take you directly to the Client Center where you
          and your designer can communicate. Alternatively, just log in and go directly to your
          Client Center to send your designer a question.
      how_long_everything_takes:
        question: How long does everything take?
        answer: >
          It depends on the project, but on average, the whole process takes​
          <b>less than a month from beginning to end.</b>
      forgot_password:
        question: >
          I forgot my password - how do I log in?
        answer: >
          Please click on the forgot password link and enter your username. A link to reset your
          password will be sent to the email address on file. Click on that link, and you will be led to an
          area to reset the password. If you have any issues, you can always contact us at
          %{hello_email}.
      how_to_upload_additional_pictures:
        question: How do I upload pictures of my room to my brief?
        answer: >
          Take as many pictures as possible but please take at least 4 with your back to each wall. Images must
          be smaller than 10M. You can upload pictures three different ways: You can text them to us at (415) 254-9089
          (please include your name) or email them to us at %{pictures_email}
          (again, please add your name), or you can upload them yourself in your brief. Login and click on 'Brief'
          in the top right navigation of the client center. Here you can see all of the details of the intake form
          as well as the images you uploaded. If you click on the pencil icon in the Pictures of your Space section,
          you can upload new images. If your designer asks you for additional pictures once you're in the collaboration
          period, you can upload them the same way by editing your brief.
      full_money_back_guarantee:
        question: Do you offer a 100% money-back guarantee?
        answer: >
          Yes! We are very confident that you'll love your design and working with our interior designers, so
          we are offering a 100% money-back guarantee. If you're unhappy with anything at all,
          please email us at %{hello_email}
    designer:
      what_is_beta:
        question: What is beta mode?
        answer: >
          This means we are still testing the product and learning from both the client and designer’s
          experience. It also means that not all elements of the final product are available yet. The final
          product will look quite different to how it looks right now. There will be bugs too, so please be
          patient - and let us know of any issues you’re experiencing.
      how_contest_work:
        question: How do contests work?
        answer: >
          First, a client fills out the style profile, giving us as much detailed information about their
          specific room’s needs as possible. All the designers will receive the brief and those who want
          to take on the project will send the client a concept board reflecting their suggested direction
          for the room. The client then picks which concept board they like the most (the winning
          design) and continue to the next collaborative phase of designing their room with that specific
          designer.
      how_communicate_client:
        question: How do I communicate with the client?
        answer: >
          All communication will take place in the Client Center on the platform. You will always be
          notified via email if the client has added any feedback to your designs.
      specs_of_design:
        question: What are the specs of the designs I upload for the client?
        answer: |
          Concept board: w: 752px h: 664px
          Final Design: w: 851px h: 751px
      vendors:
        question: Which vendors can I source from?
        answer: >
          You are welcome to choose from vendors that meet your client’s aesthetic, budget, and
          quality requirements. But please choose reputable vendors that you know you can rely on.
          We want clients to have a positive experience when they order the goods.
      can_include_work_in_portfolio:
        question: Can I include the work I do for InteriorCrowd in my portfolio?
        answer: >
          In most instances we’d love you to add your InteriorCrowd to your portfolio. But please
          reference InteriorCrowd, and don’t add the client’s details, for privacy reasons.
      what_do_I_get_paid:
        question: What do I get paid?
        answer: >
          Clients pay $299 for a room design and designers are paid $200.
          Designers are paid on the 15th of every month for all projects completed in the prior month.
          For the in-person consultation we are currently working on $100/hour fee structure
          and designers are paid $65/hour.

        story: >
          We really liked all the furniture in our dining area, but
          were just missing something to give the room that Wow Factor. Our designer picked a statement light fixture
          that we probably wouldn’t have picked ourselves and
          it’s completely transformed the room.
      john_story:
        name: John G.
        story: >
          This bed was always one of my favorite pieces, but when my husband and I got married I wasn’t sure
          it would work in our new bedroom. Our designer showed us with a few simple additions (wall color,
          a side table - and a few accessories) how we could bring our things together in a room that we now both love.
      audrey_story:
        name: Audrey S.
        story: >
          I love the look & ease of our new living room! I was
          so happy our designer was able to work in the hanging woven chair I’ve always wanted. We were particularly
          impressed with the level of detail our designer was
          able to plan for us - from the sofa right down to room
          accessories like bowls for the table. It’s a perfect room.
