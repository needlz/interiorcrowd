      vintage:
        name: Vintage
        description: >
          Originally sourced from flea-markets and antique stores to bring more eclectic pieces
          (and a bit of history) into a room, the vintage trend is now reflected by the
          increased popularity of retailers creating new pieces with a vintage feel. Choose
          either original pieces or “vintage inspired” from more mainstream retailers.
        retailers: |
          - Budget-friendly original pieces and replicas: Etsy & Chairish
          - For inspiration (or for the less budget-conscious): 1stdibs
          - ”Vintage Inspired” retailers: Restoration Hardware, Anthropologie, One King’s Lane, Schoolhouse Electric, Rejuvenation
      eclectic:
        name: Eclectic
        description: >
          It’s all about mixing and matching various styles and colors to create a unique look.
          Pick from a variety of modern retailers and match with vintage pieces for a more ‘worldly’ feel.
          Brighten up the room with patterns, color pops and ethnic prints.
        retailers: |
          - For the less budget conscious: Design Within Reach, BluDot, Hive Modern, Coup d’etat
          - More budget friendly: Room & Board, CB2
          - Vintage Inspired: One King’s Lane.
          - Worldly approach: Anthropologie, Cost Plus, Pier 1
      midcentury_modern:
        name: Mid-Century Modern
        description: >
          Often called "mod" and most definitely “retro”, this style is marked by simplicity,
          clean lines, organic forms, and materials such as wood, metal, and plastic.
          A key element is to bring the outdoors in by making the space feel as light and airy as possible.
          Molded plywood and plastic is very popular in modern furniture, as well as polished metal.
          Furniture is minimal and raised off the floor to allow the space to open up.
        retailers: |
          - Room and Board, HD Buttercup, West Elm, CB2 and Design Within Reach, Dwell Studio, BoConcept,
          Cisco Brothers
          - Online representing physical showrooms: 1st Dibs
          - Online-only retailers: One King’s Lane, Chairish, Wayfair, Amazon (if you know what you are looking for) Dot & Bo.
      rustic_elegance:
        name: Rustic Elegance
        description: >
          Rustic elegance is a combination of natural materials (like distressed wood) with modern or
          luxurious decor or accessories (like chandeliers) - to present a room that is cozy but stylish.
          This style incorporates some of the farm-inspired pieces that echo that comfortable lifestyle.
        retailers: >
          Restoration Hardware, Rejuvenation, Schoolhouse Electric
      coastal:
        name: Coastal
        description: >
          Light and relaxed is the essence of coastal (also called california casual).
          This style uses light colors (blue and green hues with bright whites) and an abundance
          of natural materials like distressed or cerused wooden furniture, jute rugs and handmade
          accessories to create a breezy, summery vibe. Many retailers will have pieces fitting
          this casual coastal theme - for example, nautical accents from West Elm, raffia furniture
          from Serena & Lily, and striped pillows from Pier 1.
        retailers: |
          Serena & Lily, West Elm, Pottery Barn, Wisteria, Pier 1, Home Goods
          Online Only Retailers: Wayfair, One King’s Lane
      traditional:
        name: Traditional
        description: >
          Trademarks of this style generally include deep wood tones, an abundance of
          architectural details (thick moldings, for example), and elegant furnishings.
          One of the most important facets of traditional interior design is the silhouettes of the pieces.
          Wingback chairs, claw footed tables - chairs or tubs, and curved furniture pieces are
          examples of how designers are finding inspiration in the ornate decor from the 18th and 19th centuries.
          Antiques are also often integrated into this design style, but many companies like
          Pottery Barn, Baker Furniture and Ballard Designs sell new pieces that mimic the lines of the old.
        retailers: >
          Baker, Kravet, Jan Showers, C. Mariani, Cache Collection, Caperton Collection, Dennis & Leen,
          Ann Getty House Collection, Pottery Barn, Baker Furniture, Ballard Designs
      transitional:
        name: Transitional
        description: >
          Transitional is a blend of traditional and contemporary styles, mid-way between Old World
          traditional and the world of chrome and glass contemporary; incorporating lines that are
          less ornate than traditional designs, but not as severely basic as contemporary lines.
        retailers: >
          Formations, David Iatesta, Ironies, Oly Studio, Made Goods, Mr. Brown Home,
          Julian Chichester, Ruby Living, Williams-Sonoma Home, Crate & Barrel
      modern:
        name: Modern
        description: >
          Clean, straight lines and simple, minimalistic decor are the main characteristics of a
          modern style. Many retailers today have pieces that are modern, with bigger brands
          like Design Within Reach, Room and Board being amongst the most popular.
          For more budget-conscious options, look at IKEA and CB2.
        retailers: >
          Design Within Reach, Scandinavian Designs, Roche Bobois, Herman Miller, Dot & Bo, EQ3, IKEA, CB2
      hollywood_regency:
        name: Hollywood Regency
        description: >
          Hollywood celebrates glitz and glamour - a time when cocktail parties were more popular
          than television series. This look can be achieved by mixing furniture from various other
          styles (from traditional to modern Art Deco) with an emphasis on details - glamorous mirrors,
          lacquered furniture, lots of gold and unexpected color combinations. The more luxurious,
          the better. Original Dorothy Draper items can be purchased from 1stdibs for a great investment
          piece, or go to Jonathan Adler for fun accessories.
        retailers: >
          1st Dibs, Jonathan Adler, Ruby Living, Z Gallerie, Oly Studio, Made Goods, Mr. Brown Home,

        This room has a lot of potential! I saw from your style profile that you
        love mid-century modern and eclectic styles, so I've added a few pieces
        that I think will go really well with your existing furniture in your living
        room within your allocated budget. If you pick me as a winner we can look into
        some options for paint as I think a lighter color will really brighten this room up.

      what_is_crowdsourcing:
        question: What does 'crowdsourcing' mean?
        answer: >
          Crowdsourcing is a great way to get ideas from multiple people for one project so that you’re better
          equipped to choose the right person for your project.<br/><br/>

          Our crowdsourcing model starts with the client (you) developing a personal style brief and sharing pictures
          of your space. That brief goes out to a network of talented designers who will respond with a concept board
          that outlines their vision for your space, along with a note that describes their process.
          See how different designers work before picking who is the best fit for you.
      who_are_designers:

          Our designers are talented professionals from anywhere in the country. They are chosen to design
          for InteriorCrowd based on a combination of factors like portfolio, awards and raw talent.<br/><br/>

          We have a large and growing network of established and up-and-coming interior designers. Each designer
          goes through an extensive interview process for us to vet that their style, knowledge of design principles,
          materials and trends, communication, and ease with technology is up to our standards and that they can delight
          a diverse group of clients with different budgets, styles, geographies, and functional or aesthetic needs.

        question: How many designers will I get to choose from?
        answer: >
          Each project usually receives 3-5 concept boards from designers, but many projects do get more.
          The more information you put in your brief, the more likely you are to get a lot of interest
          from our network of designers.
      style_profile:
        question: How does the style profile work?
        answer: >
          The style profile was created in collaboration with our designers as a fun and easy way to figure out
          how best to style an amazing new space for you. Most people don’t stick to one style,
          and the profile takes this into account.

      the_story:
        title: The story
        first_part: >
          Like so many companies, InteriorCrowd started from a personal pain point.  Why was interior design so hard?
          Why did it cost so much money, take so long, and cause so much friction between me and my husband?
          When we moved into the home which we knew would be our home for the next twenty years, we wanted it
          to be just right. However, we could not seem to agree on anything.  We were left with the choice
          to either hire an interior designer or talk to a marriage counselor.
        second_part: >
          We chose to hire an interior designer. And, while she had great ideas, the process was so painful.
          No transparency on pricing. No clarification on time-lines. A constant push to buy the most expensive,
          custom products (that we didn't need and which were always delivered wrong). A full twelve months later,
          we were left with an unfinished house, several beautiful pieces, and significantly less money
          on the checkbook. Has we chosen wrong? Not done our homework? My husband and I are both entrepreneurs...
          surely we couldn't have be duped. Then I realized that the process itself is simply broken.
        third_part: >
          I thought there had to be a better way.
        forth_part: >
          That was the genesis of InteriorCrowd, and that is our mission. Our spaces inspire our lives:
          if we wake up in a space that feels safe, comfortable, and ours - then we feel at home.
          And we at InteriorCrowd believe that great design does not have to be costly and inaccessible.
        fifth_part: >
          We are partners of the industry. We are building a platform to connect, not dis-intermediate.
          Everywhere you look, there is inspiration - an overwhelming amount of it. Our goal is to be the bridge
          between the inspiration that you see and the space that you need. Our designers are the lifeblood
          of what we do. They inspire us. And, we humbly do our best to provide them with the best platform,
          the best tools, and the best support, so that they can do their best work. For you.

        name: Jane L.
        story: >
          We really liked all the furniture in our dining area, but
          were just missing something to give the room that Wow Factor. Our designer picked a statement light fixture
          that we probably wouldn’t have picked ourselves and
          it’s completely transformed the room.
      john_story:
        name: John G.
        story: >
          This bed was always one of my favorite pieces, but when my husband and I got married I wasn’t sure
          it would work in our new bedroom. Our designer showed us with a few simple additions (wall color,
          a side table - and a few accessories) how we could bring our things together in a room that we now both love.
      audrey_story:
        name: Audrey S.
        story: >
          I love the look & ease of our new living room! I was
          so happy our designer was able to work in the hanging woven chair I’ve always wanted. We were particularly
          impressed with the level of detail our designer was
          able to plan for us - from the sofa right down to room
          accessories like bowls for the table. It’s a perfect room.
